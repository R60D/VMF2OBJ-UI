## What is this?
   - Simple to use UI for VMF2OBJ made in python.
## How do I use it?
  - Just put it in the same folder as the VMF2OBJ.jar file and launch it.
## Options
  - There is a .exe and a .py
  - The .exe contains alot of libraries due to qtpy5 and submodule dependencies.
     - This means that It's just launch and forget.
  - You can alternatively launch the .py if you install the dependencies.
