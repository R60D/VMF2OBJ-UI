## Troubleshooting
If you are  having problems try launching it in administration mode and update python to latest version

## Options
  - There is a .exe and a .py
  - The .exe contains alot of libraries due to qtpy5 and submodule dependencies.
     - This means that It's just launch and forget.
  - You can alternatively launch the .py if you install the dependencies.
